          <p id="a">
          Google Cloud offers a collection of public datasets and pre-built data solutions powered by BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and other services, facilitating analytics and AI initiatives. <br />
          It provides real-world data for experimenting with data-driven applications, especially for building dashboards, visualizations, or machine learning models. Developers can also learn to integrate cloud-native analytics tools into their projects.
          In my case I could use it to better familiarize myself with using datasets.<br />
